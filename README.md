# QPack
In this repository,the QPack Benchmark for quantum computing is presented. QPack aims to set the standard for evaluating quantum- hardware and simulators, using meaningful metrics and practical applications. The QPack benchmark makes use of quantum algorithms, applied to different applications, to evaluate quantum computers and quantum simulators. The quantum applications are implemented as they would be in practice, using minimal (quantum) resources and aiming for an optimal performance. As more quantum applications become practical on quantum hardware, these applications will be included in the QPack benchmark.

The schematic outline for the QPack benchmark is shown below ![here](https://github.com/koenmesman/QPack/blob/main/Benchmark_schematic.png?raw=true).

This repository is currently under construction.
